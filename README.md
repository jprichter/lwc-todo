# lwc todo app

A Salesforce Lightning Web Component made to familiarize myself with this new framework.

Create a scratch, clone the repo, push. Then drag the component onto any Flexipage. 

To Dos are a Record Type of Tasks. The component is context aware and sets the WhatId based on the record on which it 
was created.
